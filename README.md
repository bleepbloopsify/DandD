# DandD
Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Master API

### TL;DR: A tool for a Dungeon Master (DM) to record all data pertaining to the the game. Other players can also look at it and see information pertaining to their own character.

##### Understood:  
  Databases (mongoDB) to store each account's information (games, characters, items, monsters, story progress)  
  Forms to grab the information entered by the DM  
  CSS to prettify

  flask-socketio to constantly update the information
